# Brainstorm

## Questions: What do we want to learn?

>> We want to learn which stations have the highest amount of traffic, as well as when they experience high traffic.
Additionally, it would be a bonus to hypothesize where larger numbers of women in tech are getting on and off the
subway, and when.

## Data: What is wrong with the data?

>> The Entry and Exit data is stored as a cumulative count, rather than as change. The problem with simply creating
a new column with the differences is that when you switch to a new turnstile, the count is different.
